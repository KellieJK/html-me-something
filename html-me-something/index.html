    <h1>A quick trip to Scotland</h1>
   </main>
  </header>

     <p>About 2 months ago my sisters and I took a trip to Scotland. It was my first vacation in several years so we wanted to make sure it was a blast! Accompanied by a group of our friends, we rented out a castle by the sea and a nearby cottage. For a week we tried not to think of the outside world. Most days consisted of relaxing and wandering the Scottish hills in the chilly, early days of March. It is sort of difficult to imagine such a blissful couple of days were so recent. The day we were due to fly back to the United States we heard all about the COVID-19 lockdowns and flights being cancelled. I am so glad we got to go before we would not be able to venture out for a while.</p>  
     
     <h2>My favorite things from our trip:</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>The peace and quiet!</li>
  <li>The ancient and wonderful historic places we got to explore.</li>
  <li>Going on a fun trip with my best friends.</li>
  <li>Sleeping in!</li>
  </ol>

    <h3><em> Scotland was a dream and I would love to go back someday! </em></h3>

    <p><b>Asia:</b></p>
 
  <p>I have always wanted to go to different Asian countries. Japan seems really interesting and I'm sure the food would be incredible. Thailand and Singapore are also on the list! </p>
